        <p>Happiest birthday Dhanya!!! Finally I have someone in vja who I can meet 😂😂... I think we both would agree that we can't speak in telugu with each other n I think thats what defines our friendship.
          Who knew we would get so close n start having sessions n stuff 😂😂 .. I always knew that u were a tough egg to crack but on Nov 22nd last year I saw the real side of u n I was so happy to have found such a genuine person like u and Im 
          so happy that u opened up to me even though it was under influence of u know what 😂😂.Since that day I knew that u were worth a 5 hour drive, even though we got to spend only few hours I was happy that as soon as I came u instantly made me feel at home n ur mom is amazing n her cooking too 😂😂 
          .. okay okay I'm gonna stop here before u think it's too long n it needs to be cut short .. I love you so so much and always remember I'm there for u for life❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

      <p>Umm..... where to start🤔. Well you aren't the best😶, rather your looks said so🥴. You seem to be the gloomiest person sitting in the corner with no interest🥱 same as me in my last class of the day just waiting to leave😖. But when i see you started doing work, you are very interactive and enjoying what you are doing but not the some dull looking one and i thought is that the same girl or someone else😯 . From that day whether you are the one i get to irritate😅 or i am the victim of your drama😒, you had been one of my stress buster and i can never ever forget those moments ❤️. Finally Wish You Man
        y More Happy Returns Of The Day ARAVAPALLI DHANYA SRI🎂🥳🥂 and keep on moving forward crossing the barriers ahead and enjoy your day😜.</p></div>

U always know what u want and what ur doing...get it going bae...long long way to go💯. U will always have a good priority on my chat don't worry 😂...I'm just a call or text away if in case needed. Happy birthday kiddoo💕😊.

      <p>HAPPY 19TH BIRTHDAY BABUUUUU!!
        well,idk where to begin,besides the fact that it’s your last teen birthday and feels like i’m being more disappointed about this,.From being the most nerd girl  to being the sarcastic person now!! time flew..
        We should probably thank each other for listening to each other rants every time we go crazy and get pissed while watching cricket..anyway jokes apart, coming to the lil emo side,the moment we all choose to differ our paths that’s when i  realised how much you mean to me and when we entered into new world which is so called ‘university world’ it was definitely a freakin CHALLENGE for us to find new friends and it WAS a challenge, and there could never be a day without atleast sending a text/meme,i will always cherish 7YEARS of our friendship and to lifetime of memories! Thanks for being as supportive as you are. Just because it’s your last teen bday i’m trying to be nicee.
         Love you dhanyoooo❤️❤️!!</p></div>
